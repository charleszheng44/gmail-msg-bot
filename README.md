# Gmail Bot

The Gmail bot is designed to monitor a designated Gmail account for incoming 
email containing user-specified keywords, and send notifications to messaging 
applications such as Lark and Slack.

Please setup the necessary environment and auth by following [Python quickstart](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python).
